You will encrypt a message and save it to a file.
You will read from the file and decrypt the message, printing it to the console.



A Caesar Cipher involves one encrypting a message by replacing each letter in it with a “shifted” letter.
If you shift the letter A by one space, you get the letter B.
If you shift the letter A by two spaces, you get the letter C.
Refer to the diagram to get a mental picture of what is required:




The console should display something akin to the example below:



Do you wish to encrypt or decrypt a message?

encrypt

Enter your message:

The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.

Enter the key number (1-52)

13

Your translated text is:
gur FxL noBIr Gur CBEG JnF Gur pByBE Bs GryrIvFvBA, GHArq GB n qrnq punAAry.
Do you wish to encrypt or decrypt a message?

decrypt

Enter your message:

gur FxL noBIr Gur CBEG JnF Gur pByBE Bs GryrIvFvBA, GHArq GB n qrnq punAAry.

Enter the key number (1-52)

13

Your translated text is:

The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.
Using the incorrect key:



Do you wish to encrypt or decrypt a message?

decrypt

Enter your message:

gur FxL noBIr Gur CBEG JnF Gur pByBE Bs GryrIvFvBA, GHArq GB n qrnq punAAry.

Enter the key number (1-52)

15

Your translated text is:

Rfc qiw YZmtc rfc nmpr uYq rfc amjmp md rcjctgqgml, rslcb rm Y bcYb afYllcj.


The text that is encrypted should be saved to a file.
The text that is decrypted should read the text from the file and decrypt it.
You are allowed to include the encryption key in the file in order to read it,
or to solve this any number of other ways as long as you read and write to files!
